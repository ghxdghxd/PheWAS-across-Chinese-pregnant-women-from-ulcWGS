# Phenome-wide association studies across Chinese pregnant women from Ultra-Low-Coverage Whole-Genome Sequencing

Most genome- and phenome-wide association studies (GWAS and PheWAS) have been based on Caucasian populations. To date, there is a limited number of studies on the Chinese population. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is one of the most successful clinical applications of ultra-low-coverage whole-genome sequencing in prenatal genetic testing for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. NIPT’s massive parallel sequencing can provide population-wide genomic information and electronic health records applying to PheWAS without incurring into high additional costs. Here, we report an association study crossing genome and phenome from 25,639 pregnant women and 14,151 newborns, which provided high potential genetic determinants of maternal diseases and maternal-newborn comorbidities in the Chinese Han population. We yielded 8,454 maternal trait-associated loci (TAL), including 47 phenotypes at statistical power > 0.8 and P < 5 × 10-8. Of note, 99.5% of the latter are located in cis-regions (< 50kb) of known GWAS loci. We pruned the maternal TAL to 1,112 unique LD-blocks based on linkage disequilibrium (R2 > 0.8), of which 82.9% were pleiotropic, and 50.8% were the reported acting on the same phenotype via the pathogenic gene in cis. Most of pleiotropic and novel disease associations were observed in the genitourinary system, skin and subcutaneous tissues, and digestive system. Finally, we identified 22 maternal pleiotropy TAL associated with 35 neonatal phenotypes at P < 0.05 and R2 > 0.8. Four of the latter TAL were associated with the same complications in mothers and children. These findings demonstrate the importance of accumulating NIPT data to inform GWAS and PheWAS and improve future preventive medicine in women and children.
